## courrierChallenge
This is a repo for a small project aimed at tallying the amounts to be received from delivery personnel. The information is sent to a queue in AmazonMQ of the RabbitMQ type. There will be 2 REST endpoints for querying the values. This is the beginning of the project, and as it grows and becomes clearer, this description will be updated.


## Infrastruture as code.
I created some scripts using Terraform to provide a minimum infrastructure in AWS to start the project.
